Android Application
The code can be compiled and run from Android Studio by loading the project root directory into Android Studio
and then clicking Run->Run 'app'.  Selecting an attached device in debugging mode will compile the application
and load it onto the selected device.

Server
Bars and events can be added to the server by issuing a simple server GET api call to an Amazon Web Services instance.  The
Server calls have been set up and are in the code.
